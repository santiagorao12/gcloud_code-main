## Google Cloud Storage Python Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for interacting with Google Cloud Storage. These scripts allow you to perform various operations on objects in your Google Cloud Storage bucket, such as listing objects, uploading and downloading files, setting object metadata, and handling errors.

### Features:

- **List Objects**: Script to list objects in a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket.

- **Upload & Download Objects**: Scripts for uploading objects to the bucket and downloading them to your local machine.

- **Set Metadata**: A script to set metadata for specific objects, making it easier to categorize and search your data.

- **Error Handling**: Error handling is included to log and handle exceptions that may occur during these operations.

### Usage:

1. Set your Google Cloud Storage credentials in the script by specifying the path to your JSON key file.

2. Replace the `bucket_name` variable with the name of your custom bucket.

3. Run the specific script for the operation you want to perform (list, upload, download, set metadata).

4. View the results and check the error log for any exceptions.
